- Player Objectives: Each player aims to pocket all of their designated balls (solid or striped) before legally pocketing the 8 ball.
- Turn-based Play: Players alternate turns unless a foul is committed.
- Win Conditions: The game ends when a player pockets all their balls followed by the 8 ball; pocketing the 8 ball prematurely grants the opponent victory.
- Foul Penalties: Specific fouls, such as scratching or failing to hit a designated ball, result in penalties and adjustments to score.
